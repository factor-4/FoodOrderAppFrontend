Food Ordering  APP Frontend 

# Project Overview

This project is the frontend of a modern food ordering and delivery application built with React. It provides an intuitive and responsive user interface that allows customers to browse restaurant menus, add items to their cart, and place orders seamlessly.

The application is designed to work with a Spring Boot backend and includes features such as user authentication, real-time order updates, and secure payment integration (via Stripe).

It demonstrates key frontend development skills, including component-based architecture, state management, API integration, and responsive design — following best practices for performance and scalability.


# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
.
Follow the steps below to set up and run it locally.

npm start

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000
 in your browser to view it.

The app automatically reloads when you make changes, and linting errors appear in the console.

npm test

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode to help ensure everything works correctly.

npm run build

Builds the app for production in the build/ folder.
The code is optimized and minified for best performance — ready for deployment.

npm run eject

Note: Ejecting is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

Use this command only if you need full control over the configuration (e.g., webpack, Babel, ESLint). For most use cases, the default setup is sufficient.
